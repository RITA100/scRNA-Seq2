# scRNA-Seq2

Hello Tuesday!
This is the first day for me using github to run the procedure of scRNA-seq,I've met a lot of question and it's a real hard time for me to learn everything new.However,everything will be fine and just do it!Hope 1 month later,I'll solve all and be good at using the github.
